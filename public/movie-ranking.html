<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3-Idiots</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. As it relates to the stuggles Engineers face</p>

<p>It gives cool country road vibes in the whole movies. Feels good and I hope I can take up trips with my friends the way it was in the movie.</p>
<h3>Ratatoullie</h3>
<p>Super Cool plot and animation done! Just Love it! I hope I get to learn how to animate characters!</p>
